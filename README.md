## Topics: Computer Vision, Robotics, 3D modelling

Code and 3d models from my work in our senior year robotics team
Participated in the Skills Canada competition, winning first at toronto regionals, ontartio provincials and nationals

Aim of the competition was to play a modified game of ball hockey using one autonoomous and two teleoperated robots. 
Our final design used 2 teleoperated ball collecting and shooting robots

My project of interest was the autonomous robot, which went through many different iterations before becoming a moving one way wall
The original idea was for the robot to drive around and collect balls itself, and although a working prototype was made, we decided that
it would be more benficial to have a robot blocking the enemy teams shots, while letting our shots through
