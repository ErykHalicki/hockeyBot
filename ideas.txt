create array of walls
function to find x y position within the court
scan for balls
try to plot ball positions in the court space
pick a ball and move there

getting position within the court:
  ultrasonic readings of distance from wall when
  create a ray of where the ultrasonics are impacting the wall? 30degress how does that affect the readings, lazer pointers?
  one side given
  if the ultrasonic sensor ray goes through a hole, and has an inaccurate reading, move ore turn robot to try getting a better readings
  depending on the orientation of the wall hit create different triangles
  
start by getting input from the arduino serial 
then send commands to through arduino serial
then determine position of robot assuming there are no holes in the wall
then write the wall oobject system
create a raycasting type thing to see where the ball would end up
robot position determied by roughly where the center is
need orientation of robot to be accurate
can get via trigonometry and gyroscope
then get the camera to work
then get the robot to rotate towards a ball it sees
then calculate the distance of a ball from the camera by radius size
then create ball objects
then try giving them a position relative to the court walls
then try getting the robot to move towards them
then create net objects
then try getting the robot to shot at the nets
then put it all together

subject to change when arm is added, more complex system

find way for software to work with both arduinos connected at the same time
tetrix and sensory arudino need to be distinguished
the two boards can print their id to serial until they are told to turn on 
that way the serial port used is irrelevant
so you can dete

	NEW PLAN

TEST NEW COMMANDS
ROLL IN A SQUARE
ROLL BASED ON SENSOR DISTANCE
MAKE MASTER SOFTWARE FUNCTIONAL
GET RASPI TO WORK

CONTINUE DEVELOPING BETTER SOFTWARE

ADD AN ULTRASOUND LOOKING FORWARD TO KNOW FORWARD CLEARANCE

BACKUP BEHAVIOUR, IF LOST, ROAM AND JUST SHOOT THE BALLS INTO THE OTHER SIDE 

PIXY2, i2c communcation possible directly to prizm controller, all code on one board AMAZING!

Find a way to possibly track position

put in safeguards to not hit the wall

think about possible edgecases/test for how well it works
there will porobably be problems with getting balls stuck in corners

create distance of ball estimation function to determine how far a ball is just based on the height of its center within the frame
